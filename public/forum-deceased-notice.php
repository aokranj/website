Dear visitor of our /forum:

Look, matey, I know a dead /forum when I see one, and I'm looking at one right now.
It's passed on!
This /forum is no more!
It has ceased to be!
It's expired and gone to meet its maker!
It's a stiff!
Bereft of life, it rests in peace!
Its backend processes are now history!
It's off the net!
It's kicked the bucket,
It's shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the bleedin' choir invisible!!
THIS IS AN EX-/FORUM!!!
